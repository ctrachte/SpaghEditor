## What is this?

Content Mgmt, based on the idea of JSON to Markdown to HTML

A method to convert JSON to HTML or Markdown, and vice-versa.

** Here's the scribbles we made for ideas and design goals: ** 
### Rough Notes

*JSON based editor*

#### One object per line
	Sub objects for formatting in line
	Order of subs dictates order of words/chars

#### Image
- Formatting 

#### Processing:
- Get text by line
- interpret format
 - Parse html
 - Store data
 - Output to 64bit encoded string
 - Output to Markdown or HTML
 - 
**Nice to have:**
- Encryption of data or parts of data
- 
#### IMPORTANT: 
- Spaghetti Themed methods, variables, and class names.

#### Potential Uses
- Service to take json string and return formatted elements to remove need for backend server To canvas output for multiple applications
